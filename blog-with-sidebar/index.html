                    In a village in Europe, there was a guy named Victor Van 
                    Dort who was born in a family selling fish. Victoria 
                    Everglot (Emily Watson), who is a gentle girl - is the 
                    daughter of a cruel nobleman.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both are preparing to marry. The wedding is expected to 
                    elevate Victor's social status and restore the property 
                    of the Victorian family. Both of them initially worried 
                    about having to marry someone they did not know, but when 
                    they first met they fell in love. Victor, a shy and 
                    embarrassing man, accidentally ruined the wedding 
                    ceremony and was reproached by Pastor Galswells. He runs 
                    into the forest, he reads the wedding vow and wears the 
                    ring on a tree shaped hand. That's the finger of a dead 
                    girl in a wedding dress.She claimed to be Victor's wife. 
                    He was taken to the dead land.

                    Dead land is not scary, it's fun and there are good 
                    ghosts. Victor heard Emily tell the story of her life. 
                    Years ago she was killed by her lover, Her lover is a 
                    fraud, after he got her money, he killed her and ran away. 
                    Emily helps Victor reunite with his dead dog Scraps, 
                    as a wedding present. In order to return to reunion with 
                    Victoria, Victor tricked Emily to take him to the Land of 
                    the Living by pretending he wanted her to meet his 
                    parents. She agrees and takes him to see Elder Gutknecht 
                    the goodwill commander, to take him back to the 
                    Land of Lives.

                <p>
                    Upon arriving home, Victor told Emily to wait in the 
                    woods and he rushed to meet Victoria and expressed his 
                    desire to marry her immediately, and Victoria responded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As soon as they were about to kiss, Emily came in and 
                    saw the two of them. She felt betrayed and distressed, 
                    and she angrily dragged Victor back to Dead Land. 
                    Victoria tells her parents that Victor is forced to 
                    marry a dead girl. Victoria's parents thought daughter 
                    was crazy and locked her in the room.
