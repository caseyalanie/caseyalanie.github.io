                <p>
                    The sugar glider is one of a number of volplane (gliding) 
                    possums in Australia. It glides with the fore- and 
                    hind-limbs extended at right angles to the body, with feet 
                    flexed upwards.
                    <sup>[26]</sup> 
                    The animal launches itself from a tree, spreading its 
                    limbs to expose the gliding membranes. This creates an 
                    aerofoil enabling it to glide 50 metres (55 yards) or more.
                    <sup>[28]</sup> 
                    For every 1.82 m (6 ft 0 in) travelled horizontally when 
                    gliding, it falls 1 m (3 ft 3 in).
                    <sup>[26]</sup> 
                    Steering is controlled by moving limbs and adjusting the 
                    tension of the gliding membrane; for example, to turn 
                    left, the left forearm is lowered below the right.
                    <sup>[26]</sup>

                <p>
                    This form of arboreal locomotion is typically used to 
                    travel from tree to tree; the species rarely descends to 
                    the ground. Gliding provides three dimensional avoidance 
                    of arboreal predators, and minimal contact with ground 
                    dwelling predators; as well as possible benefits in 
                    decreasing time and energy consumption
                    <sup>[29]</sup> 
                    spent foraging for nutrient poor foods that are 
                    irregularly distributed.
                    <sup>[30]</sup> 
                    Young carried in the pouch of females are protected 
                    from landing forces by the septum that separates them 
                    within the pouch.
                    <sup>[26]</sup>
                </p>
                <h4 id="torpor">Torpor</h4>
                <p>
                    Sugar gliders can tolerate ambient air temperatures of up 
                    to 40 °C (104 °F) through behavioural strategies such as 
                    licking their coat and exposing the wet area, as well as 
                    drinking small quantities of water.
                    <sup>[17]</sup> 
                    In cold weather, sugar gliders will huddle together to 
                    avoid heat loss, and will enter torpor to conserve energy.
                    <sup>[31]</sup> 
                    Huddling as an energy conserving mechanism is not as 
                    efficient as torpor.
                    <sup>[31]</sup> 
                    Before entering torpor, a sugar glider will reduce activity 
                    and body temperature normally in order to lower energy 
                    expenditure and avoid torpor.
                    <sup>[32]</sup>
                    <sup>[33]</sup> 
                    With energetic constraints, the sugar glider will enter 
                    into daily torpor for 2–23 hours while in rest phase.
                    <sup>[31]</sup> 
                    Torpor differs from hibernation in that torpor is usually 
                    a short-term daily cycle. Entering torpor saves energy 
                    for the animal by allowing its body temperature to fall 
                    to a minimum of 10.4 °C (50.7 °F)
                    <sup>[31]</sup> 
                    to 19.6 °C (67.3 °F).
                    <sup>[34]</sup> 
                    When food is scarce, as in winter, heat production is 
                    lowered in order to reduce energy expenditure.
                    <sup>[35]</sup> 
                    With low energy and heat production, it is important for 
                    the sugar glider to peak its body mass by fat content in 
                    the autumn (May/June) in order to survive the following 
                    cold season. In the wild, sugar gliders enter into daily 
                    torpor more often than sugar gliders in captivity.
                    <sup>[33]</sup>
                    <sup>[34]</sup> 
                    The use of torpor is most frequent during winter, likely 
                    in response to low ambient temperature, rainfall, and 
                    seasonal fluctuation in food sources.
                    <sup>[31]</sup>

                    Under the prior taxonomy, the sugar glider was not 
                    considered endangered, and its conservation rank was 
                    "Least Concern (LC)" on the IUCN Red List.
                    <sup>[2]</sup> 
                    However, with newer taxonomic studies indicating that 
                    it has a small and restricted range, it is now thought 
                    to be far more sensitive to potential threats. For example, 
                    the species' native range was hit hard by the 2019-20 
                    Australian bushfires, which occurred just a few months 
                    prior to the publishing of the study indicating the true 
                    extent of its range. Sugar gliders use tree hollows, 
                    making them especially sensitive to intense fires.
                    <sup>[53]</sup> 
                    However, despite the loss of natural habitat in Australia 
                    over the last 200 years, it is adaptable and capable of 
                    living in small patches of remnant bush, particularly if 
                    it does not have to cross large expanses of cleared land 
                    to reach them. Sugar gliders may persist in areas that 
                    have undergone mild-moderate selective logging, as long 
                    as three to five hollow bearing trees are retained per 
                    hectare.
                    <sup>[54]</sup> 
                    Although not currently threatened by habitat loss, the 
                    ability of sugar gliders to forage and avoid predators 
                    successfully may be decreased in areas of high light 
                    pollution.

                    Conservation in Australia is enacted at the federal, 
                    state and local levels, where sugar gliders are protected 
                    as a native species. The central conservation law in 
                    Australia is the Environment Protection and Biodiversity 
                    Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act).
                    <sup>[56]</sup> 
                    The National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 is an example of 
                    conservation law in the state of South Australia, where it 
                    is legal to keep (only) one sugar glider without a permit, 
                    provided it was acquired legally from a source with a 
                    permit. A permit is required to obtain or possess more 
                    than one glider, or if one wants to sell or give away 
                    any glider in their possession. It is illegal to capture 
                    or sell wild sugar gliders without a permit.

                <p>
                    In captivity, the sugar glider can suffer from calcium 
                    deficiencies if not fed an adequate diet. A lack of 
                    calcium in the diet causes the body to leach calcium from 
                    the bones, with the hind legs first to show noticeable 
                    dysfunction.
                    <sup>[58]</sup> 
                    Calcium to phosphorus ratios should be 2:1 to prevent 
                    hypocalcemia, sometimes known as hind leg paralysis (HLP).
                    <sup>[59]</sup> 
                    Their diet should be 50% insects (gut-loaded) or other 
                    sources of protein, 25% fruit and 25% vegetables.
                    <sup>[60]</sup> 
                    Some of the more recognised diets are Bourbon's Modified 
                    Leadbeaters (BML),
                    <sup>[61]</sup> 
                    High Protein Wombaroo (HPW)
                    <sup>[62]</sup> 
                    and various calcium rich diets with Leadbeaters Mixture 
                    (LBM).
                    <sup>[63]</sup> 
                    Iron storage disease (hemochromatosis) is another dietary 
                    problem that has been reported in captive gliders and can 
                    lead to fatal complications if not diagnosed and treated 
                    early.
                    <sup>[64]</sup>

                <p>
                    A large amount of attention and environmental enrichment 
                    may be required for the highly social species, especially 
                    for those kept as individuals. Inadequate social 
                    interaction can lead to depression and behavioural 
                    disorders such as loss of appetite, irritability and 
                    self-mutilation.
